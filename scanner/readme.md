# The Lexical Analyzer (Scanner)

Todo
---
- more idiomatic code
- differentiate logical lines from physical lines
- ~~make tokenization in a loop and not tail-recursion~~
- ~~make this better overall in terms of speed~~
- ~~remove indentation levels (currently 8 ðŸ¤¢)~~ 
- ~~implement as iterator~~

How to try
---
- One way is to use the `run_tests.py` file
- The other is to `FILE_TO_PARSE={} cargo test lexer`
